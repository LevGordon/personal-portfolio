  <!-- first paragraph, with the use of <strong> for SEO when my name is googled, and a link to thinkful that I referenced -->
<p> Hi! I'm <strong>Lev Gordon</strong>. Born to Ukrainian parents on American soil - I grew up learning three languages from birth. My life was full of uncertainty up until I turned 17. That was the moment I fell in love with music and found purpose in life: to change the world for the better through deep lyrical meanings. I moved to Los Angeles when I was 18 in order to pursue this dream, yet we live in a world where creativity is hardly valued and it took me 2 years to find a career path that truly reflected my personality. At age 20, I started to learn how to code with the help of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thinkful.com/"> Thinkful. </a></p>

<h3 class="topic-headline"> About Me </h3>
  
<p> I have a complex character, I enjoy many things and resent many others. As a result - finding a sturdy career path that fits my personality proved to be quite a challenge. However, blindly walking down a path will surely lead you to a destination and I couldn't be happier that mine led me to programming. Starting life holding hands with my best pal - the internet, cemented my pre-disposition to a sedentary environment and a high tolerance for monotiny, whilst my childish endeavours seeking logical problems to solve (like sudokus for leisure) made me gravitate towards a job with enables my "brain muscle". I have found an ideal job that is not punished by capitalistic standards and truly holds value in the contemporary world. I cannot be more grateful.</p>

  <p> I am very intrigued to be able to work in a team of like-minded individuals, for reasons such as:</p>

<li>I can get help if I struggle.</li>
<li>I can learn from others.</li>
<li>I can receive feedback on my work.</li>
</ol>
  
  <!-- used <strong> on my band name to help with SEO -->
  <p> Besides my interest for programming I enjoy a lot of other activities. My main goal, as mentioned before, is music. I play guitar in my band <strong>"Red Morrow"</strong>, currently on track to finish our debut album by the end of the year. As a quick shootoff, I like activities such as: </p>
